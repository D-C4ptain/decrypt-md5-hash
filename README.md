# decrypt-md5-hash

The MD5 message digest algorithm is a cryptographically broken but still widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value. Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities.

## About
A simple python script that goes through a wordlist to decrypt an MD5 hash.

## USAGE:
	- python decryptmd5.py md5hash wordlistpath

example:

- Python decryptmd5.py ab334feeb31c05124cb73fa12571c2f6 /home/worldist.txt
